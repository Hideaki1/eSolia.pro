On 29th July, 2015, Windows 10 distribution will begin. As has been reported in various media, Microsoft intends to make Windows 10 their "last OS". Future upgrades will likely take the approach of Mac OS X, adding features with free patches.

## New Features in Windows 10

Following is the some new features in Windows10.
Windows10には様々な新機能が搭載されるが、いくつかの機能を紹介してみよう。

### Start Menu is back.

Start Menu, that has been deleted in Windows8, is coming back.
For users were using 2 different UI in Win8 but from Win10, OS can be operated hierarchially just like Windows7.
Many people are desiring this feacure back for sure.

### Cortana is ready

Cortana, was implimented in Windows Phone8, is coming with Windows10.
It is basically same feature as Siri in iPhone.
Unfortunately it is hard to say "usuful" in current vocal recognition technology nowdays though.

### Spartan, the new browser

We are finally getting away of IE! new defaulted brouswer, Spartan is coming out.
The remarked function of Spartan, 1. notes writing, 2. Text Reading mode.

Regarding noteswriting, you can write down notes on the browser and can be shared with other users as the file format.
and regarding Test reading mode, you can eliminate all layouts or pictures and can speed up showing in text.

### Easy share to Smartphone, PC and others

As long as Windows10 can be installed to the device, file shareing will be very easy.
You can use same file in anywhere, anytime.

However, we also need to be careful about Malware attached that is increasing lately.

## Prepearation of Windows10

As you might already seeing icon in task bar, Windows10 seems to be ready for "Upgrade" mode.
However, any IT administrators knows about risk of "upgrade" installation and prefer clean installation.

To prepare for clean installation ugrade, we should plan for data backup for avoiding deletetion risk, 
It could be good chacne to start planning Cloud system(such as Thin Client) in this timing.

Also we have to think about Security policy update as mentioned in above, and very good user training to prevent any confusions that affaects to business quolity.


## When to migrate to Windows10

As you know, any sytems are unstable in first 1 year.
but Microsft alwasy relases test version and stabule version.

Just like XP after ME, 7 after Vista.

New we are having 10 after 8, we could say 10 will be stable version.
Also Microsoft is mentioning that 10 is very last version.
So we can not avoid this OS, we have to lean this OS at some point.

Ofcause, deploying user shoulbe waited for a year, but any IT engineers should try Windows 10 fast as possible.

By the way, the reason why Windows skipped Windows9 is, to avoide confusion to Windows9x, they say.

## In Closing

OS migration requires huge load of tasks, there are many risk of data lose, Operation traning, and most hard part is scheduling.

In this sort of project, you should use the company that has enough experimence and skill of migration, like eSolia.
