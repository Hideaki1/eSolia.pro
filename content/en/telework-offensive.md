## What is "Telework"?

**Telework** is what we call telecommuting in Japan. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan defines it as follows:

>**Telework** is a flexible working style using ICT (Information and Communication Technology), free from location or time constraints. <br>
_Reference_: [Efforts to promote telework in Japan](http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/presentation/pdf/110908_1.pdf)

We usually use the words **remote access**, **remote user**, **work from home**, but those have the same meaning from the perspective of a flexible working style in the larger sense.

### Telework _Status Quo_

> **How many office workers work at home once a week currently, in Japan?**

As you can see in below link (available only in Japanese), the percentage of teleworkers who work at home more than once a week is 3.9% in the 2014 fiscal year, according to Ministry of land, Infrastructure and Transport. This is a decrease of 0.6 points or 400,000 people compare with the previous year.<br>  [雇用型在宅型テレワーカー数の割合](http://www.mlit.go.jp/report/press/toshi02_hh_000046.html)
<br>
The Japan government aims to increase teleworkers by 10% of total office workers by 2020, but this seems overly difficult to achieve.

> **Why is telework decreasing in spite of government contribution?**

ICT is ever-progressing. It's easy to implement new technology. As a matter of fact, more than half of companies have already implemented a system to allow mobile work from outside of the offices, so from this point of view we should say it is already somewhat common, especially for sales reps or IT engineers.

In short, it is not a technical problem that teleworker employment is not really catching on.

### Telework success via a paradigm shift

Allow me to share a personal experience: When I was pregnant 11 and 6 years ago, I actually used telework. We didn't have a formal telework system in our company, but thanks to my understanding boss, I was able to work at home without interference to our business. In fact, I thought it was more efficient and productive for a company to allow work at home, especially in the case of suffering with terrible morning sickness or big tummy for the 2-hour round-trip on a crowded train.

However, that is just an example for using telework during pregnancy or maternity leave, but there are other cases. For example, it is more efficient to work at home when you need to concentrate on creating reports or presentation documents in some cases. In order to get familiar with telework, it is indispensable for companies to gain more understand of the advantages of telework.

It's not just a social welfare, or a "telework offensive" with productivity as a goal, but rather simply a matter of using the latest various ICT tools to provide the same working environment at home, as one has in the office.

The reason why telework hasn't prevailed yet is there is still the paradigm that the telework isn't productive, and it is only for social welfare. Telework will let your business be more productive, so, the secret of success is a paradigm shift.

Focusing on productive, there are below advantages for telework. 

* Retain superior human resources in various working styles
* Operational efficiency will make businesses speed up 
* Cost reduction with shorten commutes
* As the part of business continuity planning

As seen above, Telework would be finally able to implement once those benefits are recognized with having sense of purposes.

## ICT Tool deployment and usage

> **There are various Telework styles, but it will be useful having below ICT tools.**

**_Necessary Systems_**

- Internet
- Email

**_Nice-to-have Systems_**

- Cloud time-tracking system
- VPN and remote access
- Internal Instant message system
- Video conference or Video chat system　
- Cloud Phone system
- Printer

First, you need to discuss how to implement Telework internally. Once **"Offensive telework"** becomes reality, it will lead result in increased productivity, improving employee satisfaction and retain superior human resources.

And, there are subsidy systems as below for small and medium-sized companies in order to go ahead with Telework.  It will help your business with making effective use of those subsidy system.
