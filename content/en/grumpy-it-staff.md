Have you ever seen the famous TV drama called "IT Crowd"? It's a really funny British sitcom, in which the protagonists always rather grumpily say:

> Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?

... when answering support calls over the phone. It's really well-done as a TV series, but, how about the situation at your company?

## Is your Internal IT Grumpy?

A IT helpdesk engineer needs to intaract with various departpents and various employees so the person who works in this position is very important to have a human skills.  
You probably want to think calling a more pleasant staff than a grumpy staff if you receive the same advice as 「Have you tried turning it off and on again?」

There are probably some reason for being grumpy, someting like busy, lack of sleep, etc... 

You might think it's OK if he does what he needs to do even he is grumpy. But if there is only one IT staff in your comany, there are some risks to consider.

## Should you Outsource your IT?

Altough it depends on the size of a company, the IT outsourcing is efficient in a comprehensive manner especially in case of a midium-sized company which is under 200 employee. 

And it is not easy to find a right IT staff for foreign affriated comany who can speak English, do what needs to do and also have sperior human skills, if you find someone like this, he or she should be very expensive. 

And, in this size of company, there often only one IT staff who is handling everything on IT related issue. If you only have one IT staff, there are following risks;

* There are no one who can do IT work in case a IT staff is sick.
* IT担当者が急に退職した場合、IT管理者を急に失う
* 独りで担当しているので、情報共有を前提にしていない為、情報管理が乱雑
* そもそもスキルが不十分(偏りがある)
* 土日作業等、個人にかかる負担が多い
* 発生するプロジェクトによって仕事のボリュームが一定でないので人件費等のコスト管理が困難
