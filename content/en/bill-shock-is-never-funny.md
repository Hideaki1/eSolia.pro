## A trap in Business Trip – Electronic devices are always useful even in foreign countries

This is an era that someone can even broadcast himself setting fire to home by accident, no matter you speaks English or not, you might need to go on a business trip to other countries. With such an opportunity, bringing your smart-phone, portable Wi-Fi router and such is becoming pretty common, I feel.
What I would like to tell this time is, about a story that you often hear about, but still being repeated periodically, related to those electronic devices.

## What on the earth is data-roaming ? – Has the oversea usage been properly notified to users in your company ?

When it comes to the business trip abroad, what you needs to be careful is, about the international roaming on your smart-phone.
Call function is separated and not related, the packet transmission is what is about. (In Japan, data-roaming is basically about only transmission, but in other country you should see a separated menu ”voice-roaming” probably.)
If this function is ON, wherever you are in foreign countries, it enables your cellphone to connect a local carrier and allow to send/receive mails, browse, or even to check the Google map, just like you’re in Japan. But you should know one thing, that the transmission fee is really really expensive in other countries.

The other day, there was an incident that caused a 700,000 yen of transmission fee at 1 night. (Just 1 night..)

You may think, “he/she was just stupid because there must be the oversea-unlimited-packet-plan by each carrier..”, like this.
Exactly you are right. But it is probably not so kind as you think and won’t be applied unless you set the devices properly. 
Do you know the word “Pake-shi” (≠bill shock) was popular many years ago. I have to say, it still does exist in the scene.
If there is no one to notify it correctly, or the admin-section in charge has never notified it, you could be the one to cause the bill shock at 1 night. 

## In closing

For this sort of matters, please contact eSolia.
